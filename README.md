IMPORTANT:
ISSUE WITH GETTING DATA FROM GOOGLE MAPS API AS IT IS NOW NOT FREE ANYMORE.
THE PROJECT WON'T WORK UNLESS THE MAP KEY USED IS PAID FOR. AT THE MOMENT NO MARKES WILL SHOW ON THE MAP.



How to run the project:

Run the index.html page and check the project out.
In order to compile the whole project please run the "GRUNT" command from command line within the project folder.



Project behaviours:

You can select the bike station on the map.
By clicking on the marker it shows information about the bike station name, address, station capacity, bikes available and docks avaialble too.



Project tech setup:

The project has been implemented on a MAcBookPro using Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari. It is fully responsive, mobile first approach. It provides mobile, tablet and desktop versions.
Also, the project is IE compatible. IE8(included) upwards.

I've used JavaScript, jQuery, SASS, CSS3, HTML5 and GRUNT as JS task runner.
Naming convention followed are BEM, OOCSS and SMACCS.

As for the JavaScript structure, I've used the Module pattern. I've organised my code using namespacing for ease of programming as well as to create encapsulation and avoid variables and functions collisions.
